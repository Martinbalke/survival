# Communication Plan
After hours communication will start with slack. </br>

At the beginning of the meeting we have a small amount of time to small talk and get to know each other. Then we have a ten minute project breakdown where everyone gets a chance to discuss how they are feeling about the project and how their work is going.

All ideas are brought up in round table discussion and every person should voice their opinion and after which a group decision is brought to democratic vote.

Being mindful of other peoples opinions, encourage availibility and approachability, friendliness needs to be a major consideration in interpersonal interaction.
