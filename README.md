We set out and accomplished creating a text-based survival game (interactive fiction) set in the future that displays each of the skills we've acquired during the 201 course.

The user is given a brief descriptive backstory about the main characters and is given a scenario with three choices to solve the current problem. Each scenario can be solved in three different ways, using one of the character's classifications.  Utilize the soldier, specializing in brute force, the engineer, whose technical expertise in various mechanics can provide relief from the current predicament, or the hacker, whose expert programming skills can infultrate various networks and devices.

The page is utilizing CSS for the styling, HTML with basic HTML5 structure, JavaScript utilizing DOM manipulation, constructor functions for the story generator, the randomization of events, question generating, the utilization of if/else statements, and event listeners listening for clicks. We also have a stretch goal to add video/audio playback.
