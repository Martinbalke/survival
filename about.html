          <p class="placeText">Prior to Code Fellows, I was a Client Services Coordinator and Program Coordinator in residential support services. I decided to learn software development because I realized that the healthcare industry could benefit from automation and other technologies, and am seeking solutions to several problems in the healthcare industry. Many healthcare companies rely on web technologies, but these technologies are often outdated and inefficient. These companies also often suffer from budgetary issues and high turnover. New technologies and automation can help to resolve these issues by reducing overhead costs. I would like to utilize these skills as a healthcare administrator, or developer. I have a solid educational foundation in psychology and research, experience managing teams, experience in conflict resolution, experience in mentoring/training, audio/visual production skills, an appreciation for UX/UI, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premier skills, and much more.</p>

          <p class="placeText">Before coding, I worked as an accomplished chef at the best restaurants in Seattle and around the United States. I experienced the world of software development during a brief stint cooking at Google, where I realized I wanted the work/life balance the tech industry gives it's employees. After I started coding, I fell in love and realized that the skills of a chef translate to coding incredibly well. My experiences with problem solving, working in and managing small teams, and producing quality results for consumers have helped me excel. I'm excited to bring my unique perspective gained through hard work in kitchens into coding and shake things up.</p>

          <p class="placeText">I'm currently working part-time at a ceramic painting studio at Crossroads mall while I study software development at CodeFellows in Seattle. I am a self-taught artist adept at semi-realistic digital artworks, though I've also dabbled in pixel artworks for games that I've programmed. My coworkers and commissioners frequently compliment me on my attention to detail and I believe that my extensive artistic background gives me a unique perspective when it comes to software development. At the moment, I'm seeking opportunities to develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm also looking for exposure to roles dealing in C++. I'm inspired by independent developers who work on making their own video games and would love an opportunity to inspire others in the same way.</p>

          <p class="placeText">Before Code Fellows, I worked as a senior service agent for Fedex, refining my customer service and IT skills. I decided to learn software development for financial reasons since IT positions are the leading career choices in this field. I’m looking to take on a career change that will benefit my family more than my current job. I picked this skill because it is similar to my previous IT experience. The ideal environment I’d use this skill in is either in an entrepreneurial sense or at a startup to build my resume.</p>
